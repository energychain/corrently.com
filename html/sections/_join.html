        <h1>Become CORI shareholder</h1>
        <p><strong>STROM</strong>DAO itself does not sell CORI. There are three options to become a shareholder.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Get an <a href="https://corrently.de/">electricity tariff</a> in Germany and receive CORI tokens with the Corrently loyalty programme.</li>
          <li>Buy CORI tokens from any <a href="https://app.instex.io/0x725b190bc077ffde17cf549aa8ba25e298550b18-WETH">decentralized crypto exchange</a> supporting ERC20 tokens.</li>
          <li>Contact <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x725b190bc077ffde17cf549aa8ba25e298550b18#balances">shareholders</a> and/or asset operators</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Dividend Payouts</h2>
        <p>Profit from assets is shared with token holders. While <strong>STROM</strong>DAO services
need to have certain centralized elements for its energy market services, we strive towards
decentralization and the minimization of trust related issues.</p>
<p>All asset income for the CORI token is publicly reported and visible on its payout smart contract.
To verify the integrity of  data, users will be able to check entitled dividends
on this website. </p>
<p>Based on these monthly results, <strong>STROM</strong>DAO loads the ETH (Ethereum) amount of dividend
payouts onto a smart contract. The smart contract will contain a table of dividend
distributions. Think of it as a snapshot taken when dividends have been declared. Token
holders will then proceed to query the smart contract dividend distribution function to
move dividends from the wallet in which the tokens were stored at the time the
“snapshot” was taken. The smart contract will proceed to pay out dividends to the wallet
that made the request after validating all provided information. If the “snapshots” do not
match the dividend payout amounts at 100% validity, the smart contract will refuse the
payout request. This means that either all dividends will be paid out fairly and accurately
or no dividends will be released at all.</p>
<p>
The team of <strong>STROM</strong>DAO monitors real-time dividend payouts as micro transactions. However, the Ethereum network’s
capabilities do not currently extend to high-volume transactions of such small size.
For optimization tariff customers receive payouts from within a single, aggregated transaction.
</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
              <li>No action required if you have a electricity tariff from <strong>STROM</strong>DAO. Customers receive dividends directly with their monthly bills.</li>
              <li>Shareholders from outside of Germany might file an invoice to <strong>STROM</strong>DAO (disagio, tax and service fees apply)</li>
          </ul>
