          At the moment this Whitepaper is written the total supply of CORI Token is 5000 which means that renewable energy generation facilities have already been run through the due diligence process by STROMDAO and CORI´s have been emitted by the "CORI Contract". It also means that electricity customers are already eligible to get their profit share of the REGF´s. As the customer base increases the amount of total supply will also increase. As each of the newly emitted CORI Tokens is backed by an asset there is no inflation in quantity and therefore deflation in price to be expected. </p>
        <p>We established Corrently and CORI because we believe in the
          potential of micro-investments for renewable energy, and that through its application, customers may find an easy
          and efficient way of to contribute into a sustainable power supply. This will be achieved by utilizing
          what is known as an Asset Token. Our vision at <strong>STROM</strong>DAO is to allow
          asset owners to fund their activities as simply and securely as possible by utilizing digital
          currencies for project development. </p>
